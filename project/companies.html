            <p class="content">In SUA each member is given an IBM in order to identify themselves over the radio. Members are not allowed to say names over the radio because the channel is public and doing this would violate privacy. Every member's IBM is a number between 900 and 999. Each of the field supervisors and the EMS manager also have a call sign associated with their IBM. The call sign is the word car followed by the last number of their IBM. For Example, Nick Newell is Car 3, and his IBM is 203. </p>
        <div class="container-fluid" style="background-color: #DDE1E1;">
            <div class="row">  
                <div  class="col-lg-6"><p  class="content"> When new members are accepted into SUA, they start a six week intensive training program to help those members learn all of the skills they need to fufil a supporting role on an active ambulance. At the end of these six weeks, each of the probabtional members has to pass a comprehensive written and practical test in order to become full members. If they pass, they become full members and start as an attendant. In order for an ambulance to be cleared and operational, it must have at least a cleared Driver and a cleared Crew Chief. The crew chief leads and takes responsibility for all patient care, while the driver drives too and from calls. Attendants follow the Crew Chief's instructions in order to further patient care. After an attendant has been on the crew for 10 calls, they can start put in to become either a Crew Chief Progression or a Driver Progression. In order to become a crew chief progression the attendant must be a New York State Emergency Medical Technician. In order to become a Driver Progression, the attendant must complete a series of training known as Pre-DRP to learn how to drive and respond in an ambulance. As a Driver or Crew Chief Progression, the member must work with a cleared trainer until they have gained enough experience and are cleared by the field supervisors to work on their own. After that the member must work two weeks in that position and then can begin the other progression.</p> </div>
                    
               <div  class="col-lg-6"><p  class="content">  After the member has cleared both Crew Chief and Driver they must work for four weeks and then can start training. Driver Trainers are cleared immediately to clear a Driver Progression, whereas Crew Chief Trainers start as a Crew Chief Trainer Progression and must have a Field Training Officer or a Field Supervisor present to make sure that they are comfortable training Crew Chief Progressions. After the member has cleared their first trainer position they must work two weeks before they can start the other trainer position. After they have cleared both Driver Trainer and Crew Chief Trainer, when the field supervisors deem the member ready they will award them the position of Field Training Officer. This is the highest position that a member can achieve. Members can also learn to dispatch. Dispatching is separate from field progressions and can be completed at the same time as a field progression. Members must be an EMT student at least, and can start as a dispatch progression. A similar process exists for clearing dispatch and becoming a trainer. Members can also become first responders after they have been a cleared driver and crew chief for at least 4 weeks. When they are awarded this position, they are trained how to respond in the Supervisor's Fly Car (S4), and treat patients on their own if there are no ambulances available.</p></div>
